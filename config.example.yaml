# hooks should be a simple mapping of repo names to the Discord hook URL that
# should be invoked. Note that this is just the repo name; not the full path.
# So if your repo is stored at /var/lib/svn/project1 then the repo_name here
# would be project1.
#
# Hooks are required, naturally, otherwise the script can't post to Discord.
# If a repository is passed to the script without a hook, the script will
# print an error but otherwise exit normally.
hooks:
	repo1: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xx/xx"
	repo2: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xx/xx"
	repo3: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xx/xx"

# users should be a simple mapping of your SVN user names to Discord user IDs.
# You can find IDs using the Discord developer mode. More details at
# https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-
#
# Users are not required but they allow the script to provide proper user
# linking in the Discord post which is kind of nice.
users:
	jane: 12345
	john: 67890

# titles are used for the title of the Discord message. You must have at least
# one. The titles are round-robin iterated based on the revision number. Feel
# free to add as many as you want or modify the default ones.
titles:
	- A wild commit appears!
	- Someone's doing something
	- New commit! ðŸŽ‰
	- Work work work work work
	- ðŸ¤– COMMIT RECEIVED BEEP BOOP BEEP ðŸ¤–
	- Look who's getting stuff done!
	- Little by littleâ€¦

# Defines the color used for the Discord embed. Specify this as an RGB hex value
# and the script converts it to the correct Discord format automatically.
